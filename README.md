# Persian Enigma Machine

Welcome to the Persian Enigma Machine project! This project implements a simulation of the famous Enigma machine, but with a twistâ€”it uses the Persian (Farsi) alphabet. The Enigma machine was a cipher machine used during World War II for encrypting and decrypting secret messages.

## Introduction

The Persian Enigma Machine project is a Python-based simulation of the historic Enigma machine, adapted to use the Persian alphabet. It provides a glimpse into the fascinating world of cryptographic devices and their role in securing military communications during World War II. This implementation demonstrates the mechanics of encryption and decryption used by the original Enigma machine but with a unique linguistic flavor.

## Features

- **Simulates Enigma Machine**: Replicates the core functionality of the Enigma machine, including rotors, reflectors, and plugboards.
  
- **Persian Alphabet Integration**: Utilizes the Persian alphabet for encoding and decoding messages, adding a cultural and linguistic aspect to the simulation.

- **Random Rotor Settings**: Generates random rotor settings for added variability and complexity in the encryption process.

## Enigma Machine Overview

The Enigma machine was a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication. The machine implemented a complex system of rotors, reflectors, and plugboards to scramble messages in a way that was considered secure at the time.

The basic operation of the Enigma machine involved pressing keys on the keyboard, which would then illuminate the corresponding letters on the lampboard, providing the encoded output. The machine's settings, including the positions of the rotors and the connections on the plugboard, determined the encryption.

## Why Persian Alphabet?

The decision to implement the Enigma machine with the Persian alphabet was motivated by the curiosity to explore historical encryption techniques within the context of Persian linguistics. This project aims to showcase the adaptability of the Enigma concept to different languages and writing systems.
